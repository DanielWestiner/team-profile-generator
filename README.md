# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project was to create a team profile generator by using command-line features with node and the inquirer npm to generate html of the selected user input. By dynamically generating and capturing  a user's feedback to prompted questions, a user can get a high-quality file created. Tests were also written utilizing the Jest npm to help determine any issues that could arise in the code.
